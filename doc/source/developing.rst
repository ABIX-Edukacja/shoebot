Coding style
------------

This is an adaptation of the indications proposed in PEP8 for a consistent Python coding style.

We try to have Shoebot examples follow this specification. Here are some of the principles that we like to follow.

* Indent with **4 spaces**, no tabs.
* Maximum **79 characters per line**.
* Comments are in **English**.
* Variables and functions are in ``lowercase`` and ``underscored_lowercase``, class names are in ``CamelCase``.

Be sure to read the full `PEP8 specification <http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_. When in doubt, be bold!
