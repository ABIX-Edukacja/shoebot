## Building the docs

Install Sphinx and the Shoebot extension before generating the docs. A virtualenv is highly recommended for this:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Now just

    make html


## ReadTheDocs

ReadTheDocs hosts Shoebots documentation here http://shoebot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Documentation is rebuilt every time a commit is made to the master branch.
