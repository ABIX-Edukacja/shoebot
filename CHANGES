v0.2

* size() is properly implemented now
  - while before we had a commandline option to set the target surface
    dimensions, now Shoebox complies to the Nodebox/Processing model.
  - this means that the dimensions should be specified as the first
    instruction of your script, as in size(w,h) - otherwise Shoebox will
    complain loudly.

  - a mission that's far from finished (o:

* Added a run() method to the Box class
  - still needs some tuning, as for now it runs the whole script with no
    regard to setup() or draw() calls
