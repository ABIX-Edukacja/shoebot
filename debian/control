Description: vector graphics scripting made easy with Python
 Shoebot is a pure Python graphics robot: It takes a Python script as input,
 which describes a drawing process, and outputs a graphic in a common open
 standard format (SVG, PDF, PostScript, or PNG). It has a simple text editor 
 GUI, and scripts can describe their own GUIs for controlling variables 
 interactively. Being pure Python, it can also be used as a Python module, 
 a plugin for Python-scriptable tools such as Inkscape, and run from the 
 command line.
